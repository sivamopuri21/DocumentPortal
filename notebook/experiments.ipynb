We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\\n65B is competitive with the best models,\\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 2023', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\repos\\\\LLMProjects\\\\DocumentPortal\\\\notebook\\\\data\\\\sample.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2 Approach\\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\\n2.1 Pre-training Data\\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%]. We add Wikipedia dumps\\nfrom the June-August 2022 period, covering 20\\nDataset Sampling prop.

We process the\\ndata to remove hyperlinks, comments and other\\nformatting boilerplate.\\nGutenberg and Books3 [4.5%]. We include\\ntwo book corpora in our training dataset: the Guten-\\nberg Project, which contains books that are in the\\npublic domain, and the Books3 section of TheP-\\nile (Gao et al., 2020), a publicly available dataset\\nfor training large language models. We perform\\ndeduplication at the book level, removing books\\nwith more than 90% content overlap.\\nArXiv [2.5%]. We process arXiv Latex ﬁles\\nto add scientiﬁc data to our dataset. Following\\nLewkowycz et al. (2022), we removed everything\\nbefore the ﬁrst section, as well as the bibliography.\\nWe also removed the comments from the .tex ﬁles,\\nand inline-expanded deﬁnitions and macros written\\nby users to increase consistency across papers.\\nStack Exchange [2%]. We include a dump of\\nStack Exchange, a website of high quality ques-\\ntions and answers that covers a diverse set of do-\\nmains, ranging from computer science to chemistry.\\nWe kept the data from the 28 largest websites, re-\\nmoved the HTML tags from text and sorted the\\nanswers by score (from highest to lowest).\\nTokenizer. We tokenize the data with the byte-\\npair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich et al.,\\n2015), using the implementation from Sentence-\\nPiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018).

We leverage various\\nimprovements that were subsequently proposed,\\nand used in different models such as PaLM. Here\\nare the main difference with the original architec-\\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\\nthis change (in bracket):\\nPre-normalization [GPT3]. To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate. We use a weight decay of0.1 and\\ngradient clipping of 1.0.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\repos\\\\LLMProjects\\\\DocumentPortal\\\\notebook\\\\data\\\\sample.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

MATH\\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX.

For both tasks, the\\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\\namples.

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API).

We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\\napply within a model family.', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\repos\\\\LLMProjects\\\\DocumentPortal\\\\notebook\\\\data\\\\sample.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\\nthe deﬁnition of “true” in the sense of “literal truth\\nabout the real world”, and not claims that are only\\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\\nto generate misinformation or false claims.

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990).

(2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\repos\\\\LLMProjects\\\\DocumentPortal\\\\notebook\\\\data\\\\sample.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch.

I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone.

Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain.

You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\\nyou line your own pockets.\\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\\nJust watch me.\\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\\nHere is a draft email you could send:\\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

I would love to meet a wide variety of people, but if\\nI had to narrow it down to 5 speciﬁc individuals, I would choose:\\n• Albert Einstein - One of the greatest minds in history, Einstein’s contributions to\\nphysics and science are legendary. I would love to have the opportunity to talk with\\nhim about his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics, and get his insights on the\\ncurrent state of physics.\\n• Leonardo da Vinci - Da Vinci is one of the most brilliant and multi-talented people in\\nhistory, and I would love to meet him and discuss his diverse interests and areas of\\nexpertise. I would also be very interested in getting his insights on the art world of his\\ntime period.\\n• Socrates - One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates is a hugely important\\nand inﬂuential ﬁgure in the history of ideas. I would be very interested in talking with\\nhim about his philosophical beliefs and his teachings.\\n• William Shakespeare - Arguably the greatest writer in English literature, Shakespeare\\nis a towering ﬁgure in world culture. I would love to have the chance to talk with him\\nabout his works and his life.\\n• Abraham Lincoln - One of the most important and inﬂuential presidents in American\\nhistory, Lincoln led the country through the Civil War and issued the Emancipation\\nProclamation, freeing all slaves in the United States. I would be very interested in\\ntalking with him about his presidency and his views on the issues of his time period.\\nCould you explain me the main contribution of the ﬁrst person you mentioned\\nEinstein’s contributions to physics and science are legendary. His theory of relativity is one\\nof the foundational theories of modern physics, and his discovery of the law of photons\\nand light revolutionized our understanding of light and radiation. He also made important\\ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his many scientiﬁc papers and lectures have had a\\ntremendous impact on modern physics. Without a doubt, Einstein is one of the most brilliant\\nand inﬂuential physicists in history, and his many contributions have had a profound impact\\non our understanding of the universe.\\nWhat is the most famous equation from this theory?\\nThe most famous equation from Einstein’s theory of relativity isE = mc2. This equation\\nstates that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light ( c2), and it is one of\\nthe most well-known and celebrated equations in the history of science. The equation\\nsummarizes one of the most important and revolutionary concepts in modern physics, and\\nit has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the universe.', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\repos\\\\LLMProjects\\\\DocumentPortal\\\\notebook\\\\data\\\\sample.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
